# Humaira Nurul - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Maira! I have an analytical background in Data Analytics for Business and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Industrial Engineering.  My studies gave me a strong foundation in managerial, system thinking, and analytical skills.  With a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights, I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics and business analytics. 

Throughout my studies, I developed strong skills in working with large datasets and developed a keen eye to identify patterns and trends. I also gained experience in business problem mapping, data management, statistical analysis, and data driven decision making which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.  

I am eager to continuously expand my knowledge and expertise. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I am motivated by the thrill of uncovering new insights and solving complex problems through data.
